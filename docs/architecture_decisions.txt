frontend -> persons with REST
Because persons will be grow only linear over time, I decided to implment it as a REST service with no concern about message size and performance.

frontend -> connections with gRPC
Because connections will grow over time in a quadratically way, I decide to implement it as a gRPC service to adress message size and performance. This should help small clients to respond quickly over weak internet connections.

tracker -> locations with KAFKA
locations will be mass generated all the time with peaks at office hours growing randomly over time. I decide to use KAFAK for better scaling (by adding more servers on demand) and for better fail-savety (queueing data during downtimes of the server(s)).
